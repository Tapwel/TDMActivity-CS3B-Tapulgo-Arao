Poor Naming Conventions – Variables had unclear names like sss, pagibig, and tax, making the code harder to understand.
Lack of Modular Functions – The original code used a single function to handle all calculations, reducing maintainability and making debugging more difficult.
Hardcoded Values Instead of Dynamic Inputs – Fixed values like sss = 1200 and tax = 1875 were directly written in the code instead of being dynamically calculated or configurable.
No Error Handling – The program lacked validation, meaning invalid inputs (e.g., text or negative numbers) could cause crashes.
Code Duplication – Similar calculations (e.g., total deductions and net salary) were repeated instead of using reusable functions.
